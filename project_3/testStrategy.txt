1. Analysis Phase

Review your Class UML diagrams
Identify all classes and their methods
Note the expected behavior and constraints for each method
Map out the relationships between classes

2.Test Strategy Design

For each method, you need to test:
Valid inputs (normal cases)
Invalid inputs (error cases)
Edge cases (boundary conditions)
Null/empty values
Type validation
Design test naming convention (e.g., methodName_scenario_expectedResult)

3. Exception Handling Framework

Create custom exception classes for different error scenarios
Examples:
InvalidInputException
ValidationException
BusinessRuleException
Define when and how exceptions should be thrown
Plan exception messages that will help with debugging

4. Test Implementation

Write test cases using a testing framework (e.g., JUnit for Java)
Each test should focus on one specific scenario
Include assertions to verify expected results
Test both positive and negative scenarios
Verify that exceptions are thrown when expected
Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario being tested
